            I am italian and brazilian, based in London.
            <br />
            <br />I graduated in Law and worked in the field for a few years, when I have developed skills in collaboration, teamwork, and effective communication. Transferring these skills to web development, I create engaging online experiences that deliver tangible results.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since I discovered my <i>passion for coding</i>, I've
            specialized in JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have the privilege of being part of a collaborative team at DocCare, a private healthcare platform, working as a Full Stack Software Engineer.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also manage and oversee the webpage for Toda Cidad√£, an NGO dedicated to promoting debates about politics, economics, and constitutional rights.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my free time, I love to travel (I was a digital nomad for a year
            üõ´), writing (sometimes I like to write fictional stories üìù) and a
            good coffee (always ‚òïÔ∏è).
